# Stage Latency
To help detecting Task Straggler scenario. It
Measures the latency of each stage per query in the cluster
It gives the latency of stages in bucket per percentage  and per query stage

# Stage Throughput
To help detecting Task Straggler scenario and resiliency
It Measures the throughput of stages per minute per query globally in the cluster


# Tasks Per Stage
To help detecting degree of parallelism of stage
It Measures the # tasks per stage per minute per query globally in the cluster

# Streaming Throughput / Latency
It Measures the latency and throughput per trigger


# Sum Tasks Per Host Per minute
To help detecting Node malfunction on a cluster. It measures the sumation of tasks duration per host per minute
